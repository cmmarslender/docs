# Sage Wallet

Sage is a fully featured Chia wallet built on top of the Wallet SDK. In addition to a desktop and mobile app, it provides a WalletConnect API for dApp integration, and an RPC interface for scripting. The RPC API allows you to do everything you can do with the GUI, and it can be used via HTTP or the CLI interface.

If you're looking for a simple API to automate actions on the wallet's behalf, you should start by using the Sage RPC. However, if you are contributing to Sage or want to build your own standalone wallet app, you may need the flexibility provided by the Wallet SDK (which comes at the cost of complexity).
