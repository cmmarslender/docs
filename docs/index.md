# Getting Started

The goal of this website is to provide documentation for Sage and the Wallet SDK it's built with. It will cover a wide range of topics, from configuring and using Sage and its RPCs to building your own applications that utilize the Wallet SDK library to connect to the Chia blockchain.

## **Sage Wallet**
Sage is a high-performance Chia light wallet that provides a user-friendly interface for managing your Chia assets. It can connect directly to peers on the Chia Network or optionally connect to a trusted full node.

## **Chia Wallet SDK**
The Chia Wallet SDK is a Rust library that powers Sage and enables building applications that need to interact with coins on the [Chia Blockchain](https://www.chia.net/), including wallets and dApps (decentralized apps).
